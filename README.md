About The Project

The Yield Curve Plotter Project retrieves Treasury Interest Rate Par Yield data from https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/xml?data=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2024 and builds the equivalent continuous monthly zero-rate curve. The curves are available to view as a graph or as a csv which can be saved to the download folder.
